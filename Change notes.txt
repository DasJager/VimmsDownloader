in your HTML snippet for the download manager, I don't see any elements with the state attribute. You may need to modify 
the function based on the actual HTML structure of the downloads list in your application.

When you queue more than one link after the 1st download the link list is not updated it only updates when every single 
link in the queue list is finished downloading need to make changes so that after each download url list update is 
sent to update the position of the finished download
